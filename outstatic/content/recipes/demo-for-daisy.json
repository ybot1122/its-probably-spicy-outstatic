They are one of my go to comfort foods and every time we land in Tokyo, our first meal inevitably is at Gyoza no Fukuho, a chain known for their yaki gyoza (fried gyoza). The gyoza are crisp but not overly oily, extremely flavorful and garlicky. They make me feel like everything is right with the world.\r\n\r\nGyoza is one of those foods that can be both high and low end. You can find Michelin starred chef takes on gyoza and you can also find it at convenience stores in little plastic trays. They appeal to everyone: crispy bottoms, tender tops, and juicy insides. Mike and I love gyoza so much that one year we went on a dedicated gyoza hunt in Tokyo. I miss my Tokyo gyoza eating days.","prepTime":"10 mins","totalTime":"1 hr","totalYield":"12 Dumplings","recipeIngredients":["ingredient","1/2 cup of flour"],"recipeInstructions":[{"text":"instruction","image":null},{"text":"instruction","image":"bearbnb.png"}],"images":{"hero":"hawaiianrolls2.jpg","gallery":["industrial-pattern.png","jupiter-spaceship.png"]}}
